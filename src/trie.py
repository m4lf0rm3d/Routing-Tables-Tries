ðŸ“Œ Trie Data Structure Implementation

âœ¨ The Trie class consists of two main classes: TrieNode and Trie. The TrieNode class represents a node in the trie and contains three attributes: 

ðŸ‘‰ CHILD_NODES: which is a dictionary that stores the child nodes of the current node.
ðŸ‘‰ IS_END: which is a flag that determines whether the current node is the end of a network address. 
ðŸ‘‰ NEXT_HOP: which stores the next hop address if the current node is the end of a network address.

âœ¨ The Trie Class consist of following attributes and functions:

ðŸ‘‰ ROOT: the root/starting node for trie

ðŸ‘‰ insert(self, NETWORK_ADDRESS: str, NEXT_HOP: str) -> None: 

    âœ… Time Complexity: O(k) where k is the length of the network address string
    âœ… Space Complexity: O(k) where k is the length of the network address string

ðŸ‘‰ search(self, NETWORK_ADDRESS: str) -> TrieNode: 

    âœ… Time Complexity: O(k) where k is the length of the network address string
    âœ… Space Complexity: O(1) algorithm uses constant space to save child nodes

ðŸ‘‰ delete(self, NETWORK_ADDRESS: str) -> None: 

    âœ… Time Complexity: O(k) where k is the length of the network address string
    âœ… Space Complexity: O(k) where k is the length of the network address string

ðŸ‘‰ print_trie(self) -> None: 

    âœ… Time Complexity: O(k * N) where k is the length of the network address string and N is the total number of network addresses in trie
    âœ… Space Complexity: O(k * N) where k is the length of the network address string and N is the total number of network addresses in trie

ðŸ‘‰ get_all_networks(self) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]: 

   âœ… Time Complexity: O(k * N) where k is the length of the network address string and N is the total number of network addresses in trie
   âœ… Space Complexity: O(k * N) where k is the length of the network address string and N is the total number of network addresses in trie
