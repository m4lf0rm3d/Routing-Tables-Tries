"""
ðŸ“Œ Data Set Generator

âœ¨ This code generates a CSV file containing random network addresses, CIDR ranges, and next hop IP addresses. It ensures that the generated network addresses are unique and excludes reserved IP addresses, such as the default route, broadcast address, and loopback IP address.

âœ… Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of rows
